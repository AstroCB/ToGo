# ToGo
ToGo is a web app designed to help you plan out a trip with directions, weather, and Uber information in addition to a customized Spotify playlist based on your destination.

It is built on the [Google Maps](), [Spotify](), [Forecast.io](), and [Uber]() web APIs, and written primarily in JavaScript.
